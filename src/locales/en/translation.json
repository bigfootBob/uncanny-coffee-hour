        "Welcome to the Uncanny Coffee Hour, where the steam from our mugs swirls with the mists of the unknown. We are a gathering place for the high strangeness of the world—where the ancient pathways of the Fae cross with the twilight realm of the Yokai.",
        "Hosted by Odd Bob and Dr. Kitsuné (Mitch), our perspectives are as deep as our roots. Dr. Kitsune walks the bridge between Native wisdom and the spirit-filled folklore of Japan, guiding us through the world of Yokai and Indigenous legend. Odd Bob brings an American wanderers heart with a soul tethered to the Celtic mysteries, forever chasing the impish magic of the Fae. Together with Soercia, our resident Puca, we walk the line between the researched and the impossible.",
        "We believe that every legend holds a heartbeat of truth. With a blend of irreverence and deep respect, we prioritize the oldest voices among us, encouraging a profound look at Indigenous perspectives. We are here to give a voice to the voiceless and explore the philosophical threads that connect us all.",
        "This project has been brewing in our minds for years. The drinks are hot, the shadows long, and the stories waiting.",
        "Pull up a chair."

In our perfect scenario... we would do this full time, however, we have to look for ways to move faster here and there and AI has really helped us speed along some of the storytelling & special effects audio you enjoy. The episode art is typically a combination of human and AI help and it varies from episode to episode. ",

So crowd around the ‘ol computer or mobile phone… warm up those vacuum tubes… and listen in!"
