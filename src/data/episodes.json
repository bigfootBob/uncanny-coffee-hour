        "description": "<p>The wind has a way of finding the cracks in our certainty, and on this solstice we let it in. We light the room with laughter, pour thick drinks, and tell three stories that bite: a child hears promises the fog won\u2019t confess, iron boots ring down ruined halls, and something skinless drags itself up from the sea, hot breath reeking of graves. It\u2019s a Fae-forward gathering with Sortia, Barnaby the gnome, and Gracie holding the circle while our human co\u2011hosts wander off the map\u2014until they stumble back with gifts, kaiju time gaps, and a very opinionated tea.<br><br>We start with the Earl King, a warning about the peril of tidy explanations. Believe the children isn\u2019t just kind advice; it\u2019s a survival protocol when the night whispers. Barnaby then profiles the redcap of the Scottish Borders\u2014iron boots, blood-wet cap, speed that laughs at flight\u2014and the one rule that saves you when nothing else will. Finally, the Nuckelavee lumbers in from the northern coasts, all raw muscle and acid tears, stopped only by fresh water. These aren\u2019t museum myths. They\u2019re living hazard maps disguised as stories, teaching us how to read wind, tide, and silence before they turn.<br><br>When the boys crash back through the door, the tone whipsaws\u2014witch hexes on corrupt suits, hemp lattes versus fruity tea, and studio chaos\u2014but the spine holds. We trade folklore as fieldcraft: carry the right words, keep fresh water near, listen when fear names what your logic refuses. If you hike ruins, walk night roads, or love a good chill with your coffee, this one is for you.<br><br>If the shivers hit right\u2014or if you just enjoy two grown men acting twelve while a puka runs the board\u2014tap follow, share this with a brave friend, and leave a quick review. Keep your fires lit, keep your water fresh, and for the love of the old gods, watch the tide.</p>",

We pour pumpkin ales, crack a few ridiculous sponsor bits, and then step straight into two of the most unsettling Japanese ghost tales we know\u2014told with care, humor, and zero caricature.<br><br>First, a samurai trades devotion for status and returns years later to a house swallowed by weeds and wind. The scene glows with a single candle, a familiar silhouette, and hair so black it seems to drink the light. Morning peels away the comfort. Regret turns literal as living strands tighten like rope. It\u2019s a gothic gut-punch about the cost of convenience, the weight of promises, and how neglect can outlive us in ways that grasp back.<br><br>Then the fog rolls in and the tempo spikes. We follow three friends to a derelict rail crossing and meet Teke Teke, an urban legend with rules that cut deep. The scrape starts slow. It doesn\u2019t stay slow. This isn\u2019t a ghost you talk down with a charm; it\u2019s consequences at elbow speed. We unpack why the story lands\u2014precision of place, the banality of cruelty, and a monster whose physics make you run before you think. Along the way, we thread in yokai lore like the filth-licker, plus the everyday dread of hair that won\u2019t leave your space, turning the ordinary into the uncanny.<br><br>We keep it warm between chills: boundaries around accents and culture, shoutouts to our community, and a few lines we live by\u2014never whistle at night, fear is the parent of cruelty, choose love. If you\u2019re here for folklore that respects its roots and storytelling that grips without gimmicks, you\u2019ll feel right at home with us.<br><br>If it made you shiver or smile, tap follow, share with a friend who loves horror, and drop a review to help others find the show. What legend should we explore next?</p>",

We lean into spooky season with a trip through Baker City\u2019s restored Geyser Grand Hotel and along the wind-bitten cliffs below the Heceta Head Lighthouse, weaving jokes, folklore, and lived experience into a single thread: when you revive a place, you often wake the stories sleeping inside it.<br><br>Our path starts in a boomtown where stained glass and mahogany came back to life\u2014and so did the whispers. Room 302 has its gentle guardian who loves rose perfume and \u201cborrows\u201d shiny things, while the kitchen still belongs to a headless chef who won\u2019t surrender his line. In the saloon, the clink of glasses and the shuffle of cards suggest a poker game that refuses to fold. Each account turns the hotel from a museum into a conversation partner, proof that preservation isn\u2019t just woodwork; it\u2019s memory work.<br><br>Then we trade prairie dust for sea spray. At Heceta Head, the haunting feels personal, almost domestic. Locals call her Rue\u2014a keeper\u2019s wife whose loss lingers in tidy gestures and midnight humming. Books find shelves. Glasses migrate to the sink. A window seems to clean itself in a corner with no floor. This isn\u2019t spectacle; it\u2019s a ritual of care against the largest graveyard on earth: the ocean. We talk about why these stories endure, how grief and routine shape space, and where we\u2019re headed next\u2014East Coast battlefields, D\u00eda de los Muertos collaborations, and a careful dive into y\u016brei and yokai.<br><br>If you love haunted hotels, lighthouse legends, and the tender hush of good folklore, brew a cup and press play. Tell a friend who believes, a skeptic who laughs, and someone who\u2019s stayed up late in an old house hearing more than wind. Subscribe, share, and leave a review to help more curious listeners find the show. Where should we go ghost-hunting next?</p>",

You'll hear about finding stolen bicycles in a city of 90,000 people through unexplained intuition and instantly locating lost items in the jungle with seemingly supernatural precision.<br><br>The conversation takes an even more extraordinary turn when we discuss dreamwalking\u2014the experience of one person consciously visiting another through dreams. This firsthand account challenges conventional understanding of how minds connect and communicate.<br><br>We also explore famous documented cases of remote viewing, including Ingo Swann's viewing of Jupiter's rings before scientific confirmation and Joseph McMoneagle's work locating a Soviet submarine through psychic means.<br><br>Throughout our discussion, we maintain a balance of openness and healthy skepticism. Are these phenomena truly paranormal, or do they represent natural human capacities we haven't fully understood?

The protocol for encountering them is clear: lie face down, avoid eye contact, and show absolute respect\u2014your life may depend on it.<br><br>As a musician, attorney, and community builder, Kevin brings multiple perspectives to this conversation. His work with Kua'a'i Na'ulu A'uamo helps Native Hawaiian communities connect and strengthen their stewardship of natural resources, preserving cultural knowledge that spans generations.

His inadvertent use of the informal \"you\" form prompted her to quip, \"My young man, we haven't even slept together yet!\" This moment perfectly captures our blend of cultural exploration and personal storytelling that makes each episode uniquely engaging.<br><br>Saoirse transforms to introduce us to the Leshy, the unpredictable guardian of Russian forests. This shape-shifting spirit can lead travelers astray with eerie whistles or by mimicking the voices of loved ones, creating labyrinths where once familiar paths stood.

Turn your clothes inside out and put your shoes on the wrong feet to confuse the trickster.<br><br>We then dive into the legend of the Brosno Dragon, a lake monster with a remarkable historical connection. Unlike most cryptids, this creature reportedly saved the city of Novgorod from Batu Khan's invading Mongol army in 1240. When the Golden Horde paused at Lake Brosno, the massive serpentine beast emerged from the depths, creating such terror that the conquerors of nations retreated, interpreting the monster as an omen that the land itself had risen against them.<br><br>Through these stories, we explore how folklore serves as a bridge between humans and the natural world, teaching respect for forces beyond our control while providing protection through cultural knowledge passed down generations.

These protective beings guard homes and cornfields when properly respected\u2014but turn mischievous when neglected. Through the tale of Mateo, a struggling farmer whose fortunes change dramatically after building a tiny stone house for these spirits, we discover the delicate balance between blessing and curse.

This cunning monster mimics the cries of a human baby to lure compassionate souls to the water's edge before dragging them underwater to harvest their eyes, teeth, and nails as offerings to Tlaloc, the rain deity. The heart-pounding story of Yolotli, a fisherman who narrowly escapes the creature's clutches, brings this legend vividly to life.<br><br>Between these captivating tales, our hosts share drinks\u2014from jasmine pearl tea to Bloody Marys with locally sourced bacon\u2014and plenty of irreverent banter that makes you feel like you're sitting right alongside them. The episode perfectly balances educational content about Indigenous mythology with the warm, conversational style that makes this podcast so engaging.<br><br>Whether you're fascinated by folklore, indigenous cultures, or just love a good supernatural tale told with wit and authenticity, this episode offers something special.

His bargain transforms his art into something transcendent but at a devastating cost. This story resonates deeply with our hosts' discussion about creative struggles and the sometimes draining nature of artistic pursuits.<br><br>The supernatural theme continues when our guest Erica shares her chilling firsthand paranormal experiences. From mysterious moving pebbles to violently flapping plywood, her encounters in an old farmhouse grew increasingly intense during renovation - suggesting that disturbing these spaces awakened something long dormant. Most unsettling is her friend's encounter with a doppelg\u00e4nger entity, described by Native American traditions as a shapeshifter that preys on those in weakened states.<br><br>Throughout these stories runs a common thread: our connection to the unseen world often strengthens in moments of vulnerability - during illness, emotional turmoil, or when physical boundaries are disrupted.

        "description": "<p>Step into the shadowy bamboo groves and misty valleys of Japanese folklore with the Uncanny Coffee Hour as we explore two fascinating supernatural entities\u2014the haunting Nigawari and the mischievous Tanuki.<br><br>The Nigawari, a yokai rarely discussed in Western circles, preys on those who hide their true emotions behind false smiles. Our first tale follows young Hana as she discovers her sister falling under this spirit's influence, teaching us that sometimes the most uncanny horrors are the ones we create within ourselves by refusing to acknowledge our genuine feelings. The parallels to modern mental health discussions are striking\u2014this centuries-old folklore anticipates our contemporary understanding of emotional authenticity and the dangers of toxic positivity.<br><br>From there, we lighten the mood with two delightful Tanuki stories. In the classic tale of Bunbuku Chagama, a shape-shifting raccoon dog becomes a teapot at a monastery, eventually revealing his true nature and remarkable performance skills. Our second Tanuki tale introduces Gengoro, a sake-loving trickster who, during a severe drought, reveals a secret spring to help a village brewer\u2014proving that even the most mischievous creatures can show unexpected kindness.<br><br>Between sips of sake, earl gray tea, and hemp milk espresso, we weave these tales with thoughtful commentary on what they reveal about Japanese culture and universal human experiences. The mixture of humor, folklore, and philosophical musings creates a unique listening experience that will leave you seeing your teapot with new, slightly suspicious eyes.<br><br>Whether you're a folklore enthusiast, a lover of supernatural tales, or simply seeking stories with heart and humor, join us for an episode that reminds us how ancient wisdom continues to illuminate modern life in surprising ways.

        "description": "<p>Cold spirits on a spring evening and tales that chill the blood\u2014welcome to a journey through the spectral world of Yurei, the distinctive ghosts of Japanese folklore. Unlike their Western counterparts, these spirits carry their stories visibly in their appearance: white burial robes, trailing black hair, and an unmistakable air of unfinished business.<br><br>The Snow Woman, or Yuki-onna, emerges from the winter mists as one of Japan's most haunting figures. Beautiful yet deadly, she drifts above the snow with skin white as powder and eyes that pierce like ice. Her story weaves together terror and unexpected tenderness\u2014a young woodcutter named Minokichi, spared from her deadly kiss with a warning to never speak of their encounter. Years later, after building a life with his mysteriously beautiful wife Oyuki and their ten children, he breaks his promise. The revelation that follows\u2014that his beloved wife is the very spirit who once spared him\u2014speaks to the complex nature of these supernatural entities who can show both merciless judgment and surprising compassion.<br><br>Equally captivating is the tale of Oiwa, perhaps Japan's most famous vengeful spirit. Betrayed by her ambitious husband who poisoned her face to disfigurement so he could marry a younger, wealthier woman, Oiwa's rage transcended death itself. Her haunting became so complete that her husband was driven to accidentally murder his new bride, seeing Oiwa's disfigured face instead. This story, based on events said to have actually occurred, became a cautionary tale about the consequences of cruelty and betrayal\u2014so powerful that even today, those who tell her story are said to need to pay proper respects lest they invoke her wrath.<br><br>These aren't merely scary stories to send shivers down your spine. They're profound cultural narratives that explore justice, vengeance, and the enduring power of human emotion. They remind us that some promises must never be broken, some betrayals can never be forgiven, and that the departed don't always rest quietly.

Donovan Yazzie, a Din\u00e9 (Navajo) storyteller, completely transforms our understanding of these forest beings by sharing ancestral knowledge about \"Ye'i Tso\" - what Western culture calls Sasquatch.<br><br>Far from mere campfire tales, Donovan reveals how these beings have been integral to Navajo survival and spiritual understanding. He recounts forgotten histories: a small girl during military persecution who could miraculously gather food because her \"hairy grandpa\" helped her; disabled children left behind during forced relocations who were found years later, thriving under Sasquatch care; and his own wife's aunt who was rescued during a blizzard by a being who still watches over her to this day.<br><br>The conversation transitions from these protective encounters to darker accounts of Sasquatch stalking or chasing people, particularly women gathering pi\u00f1on nuts. Donovan weaves a complex spiritual tapestry connecting Sasquatch to other phenomena - from skinwalkers and \"little people\" to UFOs - while balancing traditional knowledge with his Christian faith. His upcoming podcast \"Don't Whistle at Night\" aims to create space for Native Americans to share their paranormal experiences.<br><br>A profoundly different understanding emerges: these aren't just elusive creatures but beings with moral agency, individual personalities, and deep connections to indigenous communities spanning centuries. With extraordinary physical capabilities, including 30-foot vertical jumps and tremendous speed, they remain mysterious guardians of a sacred landscape most of us barely comprehend.<br><br>Do you have an uncanny encounter to share?

Growing up in Monument Valley where mystery shrouds the landscape day and night, Donovan's childhood was filled with elders' stories told by firelight in his native language, warnings about what lurks beyond the safety of home after dark.<br><br>With striking clarity, Donovan recounts his unforgettable encounter at age 18 when what he initially thought was a skinwalker revealed itself as something far more primordial. A towering figure with red hair, dome-shaped head, and amber-reflecting eyes stood before him, unleashing vocalizations that defied human capability. The terror escalated when Donovan's young cousin came running back from around a bend, wide-eyed and panicked, having narrowly escaped what he described as a huge orangutan-like creature attempting to grab him.<br><br>What makes this episode truly exceptional is Donovan's cultural insight into the complex relationships between different beings that share the Navajo lands. He explains how skinwalkers actively avoid Sasquatch, how these creatures sometimes helped Navajo people escape from soldiers during times of genocide, and hints at an entire cosmology of interconnected beings from dogmen to entities even more dangerous than Sasquatch itself. Perhaps most chilling is his mention of cave systems containing evidence of victims from throughout history\u2014shoes, clothing, and other remnants of those who ventured too far into the children of the night's domain.<br><br>Whether you're a skeptic or believer, Donovan's testimony offers something rarely found in cryptid discussions: an authentic Indigenous perspective that places these encounters within generations of cultural knowledge. This is just part one of an extraordinary conversation that continues next week\u2014listen now and you might think twice about that nighttime hike you've been planning.</p>",

That creeping sensation where the rational mind struggles to explain it away, yet something deeper knows you're not alone?&nbsp;<br><br>Ghost stories aren't simply tales we tell in the dark \u2013 they represent humanity's oldest attempts to understand what might exist beyond our physical world. From Japanese yurei with their white robes and trailing hair to the vengeful spirits haunting American forests, every culture has developed frameworks to make sense of these encounters.<br><br>This episode takes you deep into firsthand experiences with the unexplained. A Forest Service ranger describes a terrifying encounter with a dark, smoke-like woman reaching into his infant son's crib, followed by night voices from the basement reenacting historical violence. A Marine Corps veteran shares his experience in condemned military housing, frozen in fear as a child's voice begs \"Please don't go.\" And a chilling childhood encounter with a floating \"blue lady\" apparition reminds us that these experiences often begin early in life.<br><br>What makes these stories more than mere entertainment is how they challenge our understanding of reality. Even the most skeptical minds find themselves questioning when confronted with experiences that defy explanation. As Dr K eloquently puts it: \"It doesn't matter if you believe in them... if they believe in you.\"<br><br>Join us as we explore the thin places where worlds bleed together, where the mundane gives way to the marvelous and terrifying. These aren't just ghost stories \u2013 they're windows into humanity's eternal questions about what lies beyond and what unfinished business might keep spirits tethered to our world.
